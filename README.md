# Swire Cart Abandonment

## Business problem and project objective

Swire Coca-Cola has introduced a new digital ordering platform, MyCoke360, which launched in summer 2024. Swire, like many other companies that deal with online ordering, has to worry about cart abandonment. Cart abandonment is defined as when a customer adds an item to their myCoke360 cart and does not make a purchase by
their next order date. Cart abandonment can result in delayed purchases and a loss of revenue. The goal of this project is to identify the behavioral events or sequences of events that most influence a customer's decision to abandon their cart. These events will be identified through creating a model that predicts cart abandonment. The model will use Google Analytics and order data as input data. Examining the model's results and the most significant factors in the predictions will help identify the key factors influencing customer behavior, which can then be used to create insights that improve order completion and reduce revenue loss.
